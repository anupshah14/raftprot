<h3>Mammalian Lipid Raft Proteome Database:</h3> <br>
Cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, also known as lipid rafts, are specialized assemblies of membrane lipids and proteins that regulate diverse cellular processes. 
In an attempt to clarify the protein composition of these microdomains we have developed a user-friendly database which serves as a key resource for membrane raft associated proteins. 
The database captures proteome level information of lipid raft fractions extracted from various mammalian cells/tissues/organs. The user can search the database using "Search proteins and Experiments" tab.
<div class="search_tab"></div>
<br>
<b>Search for Proteins or Experiments:</b> <br>
The search page offers variety of options to search individual proteins, list of proteins, only high confidence proteins and experiments.
<br><br>
<div class="search_page"></div>
<b><h3>Search Input Options:</h3></b> <br>
<b>Protein search:</b> <br>
The proteins can be searched based on gene name, protein name or using UniProt Ids. 
The output offers detailed information about the protein along with experimental details in which protein was found. See search output section for output details.
<br><br>
<div class="protein_search"></div>
<br>
<b>Cell/Tissue/Organ search:</b> <br>
Integration of the database with placental mammalian cell ontology (PMCLO) offers a unique search feature. 
You can search for all proteins, a subset of high confidence protein or experiments in all the associated cell lines which are derived from a particular organ/tissue (ex. search by prostate). 
Not only that membrane raft proteome from cancer derived cell lines, primary cells and perpetual cell lines can also be searched.
<br><br>
<div class="cell_type_search"></div>
<br>
<b>Organism search:</b> <br>
You can search the proteins and experiments by organism. <br>
<div class="organism_type_search"></div>
<br>
<b>Method search:</b> <br>
Researchers have used various biochemical methods to extract lipid raft fractions from the cells. 
The method of extraction might influence the raft proteome from the cells. You can search for the proteins and experiments based on extraction method as well as detergent (if used). 
<br>
<div class="method_type_search"></div>
<b>Condition search:</b> <br>
Various quantitative proteomic studies allow us to understand the dynamic aspects of lipid raft proteome. 
Experiments focused on exploring spatial or temporal dynamic expression of raft associated proteins along with both altered and unaltetred proteins can be searched using this feature.<br> 
<b>Note</b>: Protein search output will only provide qualitative information about the search parameter (i.e. list of all proteins irrespective of their directionality).
More information about the quantitative changes in individual proteins could be obtained from protein lists of individual experiment. 
<div class="condition_type_search"></div>
<br>
<b>Advanced Search:</b> <br>
A advanced search feature offers costumized search option based on multiple criteria.<br></br>
